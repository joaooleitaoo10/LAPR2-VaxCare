# US 013 - Specify a new vaccine and its administration process

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an **administrator**, I want to register a **new vaccine and its administration process**.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> [...] it is worth noticing that for each type of vaccine, several vaccines might exist, each one demanding a distinct administration process.

> The vaccine administration process comprises (i) one or more age groups (e.g.: 5 to 12 years old, 13 to 18 years old, greater than 18 years old), and (ii) per age group, the doses to be administered (e.g.: 1, 2, 3), the vaccine dosage (e.g.: 30 ml), and the time interval regarding the previously administered dose. Regarding this, it is important to notice that between doses (e.g.: between the 1st and 2nd doses) the dosage to be administered might vary as well as the time interval elapsing between two consecutive doses (e.g.: between the 1st and 2nd doses 21 days might be required, while between the 2nd and the 3rd doses 6 months might be required).

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Which attributes does the Vaccine have (besides the ones refering to the Vaccine Type)?
>
> **Answer:** Each vaccine has the following attributes: Id, Name, Brand, Vaccine Type, Age Group, Dose Number, Vaccine Dosage and Time Since Last Dose.

> **Question:** We would like to know if when specifying a new Vaccine and its Administration Process, should a list of the existing types of vaccines be displayed in order for him to choose one, or should he just input it?
>
> **Answer:** If the information is available in the system, it is a good practice to present the information to the user and ask the user to select.

> **Question:** As to the interval between doses, what time format are we to use? (e.g. days, weeks, months)
>
> **Answer:** Number of days.



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The new vaccine can't have the same Id as a previously created vaccine.
* **AC2:** All required data must be filled.
* **AC3:** The age limits for the age groups should be coherent.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is a dependency related to the US012, since a Vaccine has as one of its attributes the Vaccine Type. In order to
specify a new vaccine, it's required that there is at least one Vaccine Type already. 


### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**
* Typed data:
  - Id;
  - Brand;
  - Vaccine Name;
  - Age limits for each age group;
  - Number of doses, per age group;
  - Vaccine dosage ( e.g.: 30 ml);
  - Time interval between vaccines, considering the dose number given previously;


* Selected data:
    - Vaccine Type;


**Output Data:**

* A list with all the Vaccine Types available
* (In)Success of the operation

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

To clarify this client response: "A vaccine has the following attributes: ID, Name, Brand, Vaccine Type, Age Group, Dose
Number, Vaccine Dosage and Time Since Last Dose". Each vaccine has those attributes, but when specifying a new vaccine (
which is different from the Nurse related US of registering a vaccine), there should also be another attribute, the
Administration Process.  
There's also the possibility that there will be a "GivenVaccine" class that would have those attributes, since those are
related to a vaccine that was given and not to an actual Vaccine like the project description describes:
"For instance, for the Covid-19 type, there is (i) the Pfizer vaccine, (ii) the Moderna vaccine, (iii) the AstraZeneca
vaccine, and so on"

Summarizing, there should be Vaccine Types (Covid-19, Flu, etc...)/(Even to the same disease but using different technologies), to those types there should be different Vaccines (
Pfizer, Moderna, etc...), and then there should be a Given Vaccine class, where there is all the information about a
vaccine that was given:
ID, Name, Brand, Vaccine Type, Age Group, Dose Number, Vaccine Dosage and Time Since Last Dose.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1         |    ... interacting with the actor? | SpecifyVaccineAndAdminProcessUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.   |
| 			  		 |    ... coordinating the US? | SpecifyVaccineAndAdminProcessController | **Controller**  |
| Step 2  |    ...transfer the data typed in the UI to the domain? | VaccineAndAdminProcessDto | **DTO:** When there is so much data to transfer, it is better to opt by using a DTO in order to reduce coupling between UI and domain |
| Step 3     |    ... instantiating a new Vaccine  | Company | By applying the **Creator** pattern, the "Company" is responsible for instantiating a new "Vaccine", since it is the one who storages the Vaccines.   |
| 	 |    ... instantiating a new Administration Process | Vaccine |By applying the **Creator** pattern, the "Vaccine" is responsible for instantiating the "Administration Process", since a "Vaccine" has/contains an Administration Process|
| Step 4         |    ...validating the inputted data for the Vaccine | Vaccine | The Vaccine class should know what needs to be validated in order to actually create a "Vaccine"|
| 		 |    ...validating the inputted data for the Administration Process | Administration Process |The Administration Process class should know what needs to be validated in order to actually create an "Administration Process"  |
| Step 5         |    ...saving the inputted data for the Vaccine ? | Vaccine | **IE:** A Vaccine has its own data |
|   		 |    ...saving the inputted data for the Administration Process? | AdministrationProcess  | **IE:** An Administration Process has its own data |
| Step 7  |    ... informing operation success | SpecifyVaccineAndAdminProcessUI  | **IE:** is responsible for user interactions  | 

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

* VaccineAndAdminProcessDto
* Vaccine
* AdministrationProcess
* Company (already implemented)

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
* SpecifyVaccineAndAdminProcessUI
* SpecifyVaccineAndAdminProcessController
