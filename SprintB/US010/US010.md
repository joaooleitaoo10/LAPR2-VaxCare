| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...         | Answer                        | Justification (with patterns)                                                                                                         |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1         | ... interacting with the actor?                     | RegisterNewEmployeeUI         | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.                         |
|                | ... coordinating the US?                            | RegisterNewEmployeeController | Controller                                                                                                                            |
| Step 2         | ...transfer the data typed in the UI to the domain? | RegisterNewEmployeeDto        | **DTO:** When there is so much data to transfer, it is better to opt by using a DTO in order to reduce coupling between UI and domain |
| Step 3         | ...knowing the job roles to show?                   | Constants                     | IE: Roles categories are defined by the Constants.                                                                                    |

| Step 8         | ... validating all data (local validation)? 							 | Employee                      | IE: Employee has its own data.                                                                                                        |
| Step 9         | ... saving the created employee?	 						            | Company                       | IE: Employee owns all its data.                                                                                                       |
| Step 10        | ... informing operation success? 							            | RegisterNewEmployeeUI         | IE: is responsible for user interactions.                                                                                             |

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software
objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes
that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*
