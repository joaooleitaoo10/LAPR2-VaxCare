This was my 3rd project which I developed with 4 more colleagues during the 2nd semester of my 1st year in university.

It was finished successfully, as our team got a 19/20 grade in the evaluation. 

It was my second project using OOP, although this time I actually learned much more about OOP before and during the project development, which allowed me and my team to develop the whole application with the best practices.

All information about the project (project description and requirements) is available on the repository.
